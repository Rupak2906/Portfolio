  </div>
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    Hey, I’m Rupak Sharma—I was born and raised in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where I grew up learning the value of culture, grit, and dreaming big. Life there was fast-paced, and even as a kid, I always felt this inner drive to create something meaningful—not just for myself, but for the people around me. Coming to the U.S. for college was a huge leap. I didn’t know exactly what was ahead, but I was excited to figure it out, one step at a time.

Right now, I’m studying Computer Science and Data Science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, with a Certificate in Entrepreneurship. College for me hasn’t just been about tech—it’s also about people. I love socializing, hearing different stories, and connecting with others from all walks of life. Whether it’s collaborating in a hackathon, working on a project, or just grabbing a coffee and talking ideas, I’ve always believed that the right conversations can open unexpected doors. I’ve worked on building apps, analyzing data, and pitching business ideas—but it’s the people I meet along the way that keep me inspired.

More than anything, I believe in getting a little better every day. Whether it’s learning a new machine learning concept, exploring cloud systems, or just trying to be a stronger leader—I’m always looking to grow. I don’t just want to be someone who writes code; I want to build things that make an impact, take risks that matter, and lift others up along the way. Entrepreneurship, for me, is more than a career—it’s a way of thinking. It’s about creating opportunities, staying curious, and never settling.
